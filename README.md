## About
This tool uses GDP data over time to create a comprehensive bar graph. The bar graph allows for an easy and visual way to see which countries had the most GDP growth from 2000 to 2020.

This project was originally developed in 2021, with the goal of better understanding the process behind data visualization.

## Key Features
*   **Dynamic Rendering:** Bars have their color and size automatically generated based on the dataset.
*   **Flag Integration:** The graph displays country flags alongside the data as an easy visual cue.
*   **Color Algorithm:** Bar colors are generated uniquely based on each flag, making the bar easier to scan through.

## Technologies Used
*   **Environment:** Processing (Java)
*   **Data Format:** CSV

## Data Source
*   **Source:** World Bank Open Data
*   **Dataset:** Nominal GDP Per Capita
*   **Link:** [World Bank Data (2000-2020)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

*Note: Data here may be marginally different from the most up-to-date data, because of annual revisions.*
